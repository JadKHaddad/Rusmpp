        Connect to an SMPP server.

        This method establishes a connection to the given SMPP server and returns
        a client for sending SMPP commands and an event stream for receiving messages or errors.
        The connection automatically manages timeouts, enquire links, and other protocol details.

        Parameters
        ----------
        url : str
            The URL of the SMPP server to connect to. Supported schemes:
            - ``smpp`` for plain TCP
            - ``ssmpp`` or ``smpps`` for TLS connections
            If no port is specified, the default port 2775 is used.
        enquire_link_interval : Optional[int], default=5000
            Interval in milliseconds between automatic EnquireLink commands.
            Set to ``None`` to disable EnquireLink.
        enquire_link_response_timeout : int, default=2000
            Time in milliseconds to wait for an EnquireLink response before
            considering it failed.
        response_timeout : Optional[int], default=2000
            Time in milliseconds to wait for any command response. Set to
            ``None`` to wait indefinitely.
        max_command_length : int, default=4096
            Maximum length in bytes of incoming SMPP commands.
        interface_version_check : bool, default=True
            If ``False``, disables interface version validation.
            This library uses ``SMPP v5`` implementation to encode and decode commands.
            Binding to a server with another SMPP version may cause issues encoding and decoding commands.
            Disable interface version check to allow binding to servers with any SMPP version.

        Returns
        -------
        tuple[Client, Events]
            A tuple containing the connected client object and the event stream.

        Raises
        ------
        ConnectException
            If any of the following occur:
            - The URL is invalid.
            - The URL scheme is unsupported.
            - The host is missing or cannot be resolved.
            - The connection fails.
            - The TLS handshake fails.

        Notes

        Path and query parameters in the URL are ignored silently.
