# Rusmppyo3-Reflection

Generator for `Rusmpp` types into [`pyo3`](https://docs.rs/pyo3/latest/pyo3/) compatible types using [`pyo3`](https://docs.rs/pyo3/latest/pyo3/), [`pyo3_stub_gen`](https://docs.rs/pyo3-stub-gen/latest/pyo3_stub_gen/) and [`serde_reflection`](https://docs.rs/serde-reflection/latest/serde_reflection/)

This crate will generate all necessary `Rusmpp` types as structs and enums annotated with `pyo3` and `pyo3_stub_gen_derive` derive macros, which then can be used in `rusmppyc` to generate suitable strongly typed `Python` bindings.

Structs and enums generated by this crate are not meant to be created by the users of `Rusmppyc`, since creating
valid `Rusmpp` types is not trivial and handled by `Rusmpp` itself. Instead, these types are meant to be used as return types for `Rusmppyc` methods and functions.
