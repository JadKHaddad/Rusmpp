# Rusmppyo3-Reflection

Generator for `Rusmpp` types into [`pyo3`](https://docs.rs/pyo3/latest/pyo3/) compatible types using [`pyo3`](https://docs.rs/pyo3/latest/pyo3/), [`pyo3_stub_gen`](https://docs.rs/pyo3-stub-gen/latest/pyo3_stub_gen/) and [`serde_reflection`](https://docs.rs/serde-reflection/latest/serde_reflection/)

This crate will generate all necessary `Rusmpp` types as structs and enums annotated with `pyo3` and `pyo3_stub_gen_derive` derive macros, which then can be used in `rusmppyc` to generate suitable strongly typed `Python` bindings.

Structs and enums generated by this crate can be trivially created by users of `Rusmppyc` (no validations are performed while creating the types).
Validation is handled by `Rusmpp` itself when these types are sent across the ffi boundary.
These types can be used as return types for `Rusmppyc` methods and functions without any additional validation, since `Rusmpp` types are already validated.
